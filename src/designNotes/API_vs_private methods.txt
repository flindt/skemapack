Any method in an object that is not part of the API should be 
named starting with an underscore. Ie _MyPrivateHelper()

This will indicate to other developers, that this function is not 
part of the API, and therefore subject to chance without notice.

Great care should be taken to keep the API unchanged, so do not 
introduce new / changed methods unless absolutely nescessary. "Old" methods 
should be kept around in a functioning state if possible.
